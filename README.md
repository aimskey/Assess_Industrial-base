# Assess_Industrial-base

scrape_SEC_10K_reports.py pulls sentences from a company's 10-K filling. 

At the top of the .py file, change the 'company' name and 'words_to_find' to pull the information interested in.

Next steps:
1. Make it able to accept a list of companies.
1. For each company, look at multiple things (i.e., COVID-19, supply chains, etc.) 
1. Export the results into a .txt file?
